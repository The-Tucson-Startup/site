We all have grand ideas that we want to become our own boss. We see how companies run and we always think “I can do that better”. And in reality, there’s no reason you can’t! The hard part is to know where and how to start.

Thus, The Tucson Startup was born. It’s not easy but if it’s something you want to do, you can do. We’re here to help you on your journey to create your own Startup.

But wait!? What about all that “we partner with other startups” stuff? Well, we can’t do it all. It’s a human fact. We want to partner with others who can do what we can’t. For example, all those pretty photos you see on the site? They come from our photography partner Off Kilter Stuff right here in Tucson. 

Whether you’re just getting started, or need some help in your current Startup, [contact us and let’s get moving forward together](../../contact).
